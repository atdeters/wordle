## 📚 About This Project

This project was created as part of a [**42 Rush**](https://www.42vienna.com/en/about-42/) — a fast-paced, two-person coding challenge with a limited timeframe:

**Friday 6:42 PM → Sunday 11:42 PM**  

The goal? Work in a team, push your limits, experiment with new languages, and have fun building something from scratch.  

To up the challenge, we decided to:

- Implement the game in **Rust**, a language new to both of us.  
- Use the **Macroquad** library, enabling compilation to **WebAssembly (WASM)**.  
  - Combined with a lightweight HTML wrapper, this allows the game to run directly in the browser.  
  - Deployment is automated via **GitHub Actions**, so every push updates the live version on GitHub Pages.

## 🛠️ Lessons Learned

This Rush gave us insights into:

- **Rust syntax, ownership, and borrowing**  
- **Game development in Rust**: loops, input handling, and rendering with Macroquad  
- **Compiling Rust to WebAssembly** for browser deployment  
- **Teamwork under tight deadlines**  

It was a challenging but **highly rewarding experience**, showing how the 42 system builds **language-agnostic skills** and helps us adapt quickly to new environments.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer for 42 Students

If you’re doing this Rush too:  

**Please don’t copy our code.**  

- There’s nothing to gain from it.  
- The real fun is in **building your own program and learning along the way**.  
- Experiment, create something unique, and enjoy the process.

## 🙏 Thanks

A big thank you to **The New York Times** for the inspiration behind Wordle, and to everyone who helped us along the way during this project. Your guidance, support, and ideas made this Rush even more enjoyable!
